My application is a Python-based project that focuses on data transformation and categorization. It reads data from a CSV file, performs necessary data cleaning, and transforms the data into a specific format. The application uses the pandas library for data manipulation and the re library for regular expressions.
My application is designed to classify each data point from a specific column into one of the categories defined in a dictionary. The dictionary keys are categories and the values are regular expressions. The application uses these regular expressions to match and categorize the data points. After categorization, the data point is updated with the assigned category.

My application also includes a feature to ignore all files in a specific directory using a `.gitignore` file. This is done by writing the directory path to the `.gitignore` file.

My application is integrated (ALMOST) with LLM (Language Model) and Chat GPT. The LLM is used to understand and process the natural language data in the CSV file. The Chat GPT integration allows the application to interact with users in a conversational manner, making it easier for users to use and understand the application.

The application is hosted on GitHub, making it easy for other developers to access, use, and contribute to the project.
